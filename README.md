Developer Notes:

Shop Till You Drop is a game that has been created by 3 people throughout November for the GitHub GameOff 2022 Jam. The theme for this game jam was 'Clichés' so our cliché was 'Shop till you drop', a game where the player will shop until they drop and cannot play anymore. 

For this project we aimed to make everything ourselves, however the character models and their animations as well as all sound effects/music we didn't make ourselves. 

This is our first time publishing a HTML playable file and we used Unreal 4.23 to do it. There appears to be an issue where the game has to be in full screen to work but the HTML buttons will still appear on the screen unfortunately.
